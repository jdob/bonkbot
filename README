                        Bonk IRC Bot
============================================================

To run:

1.  Change the necessary values in config.json to reflect your
    environment.

2a. Daemon: Run "python client &".

2b. Interactive: Start python and run the following:

>>> from client import *
>>> irc, config = start()

The irc variable holds on to the IRC connection. It (and potentially
the config) are used in calls to control the bot, such as making it
send messages or join new channels.
